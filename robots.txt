# Purpose: A 'robots.txt' file to block generative AI scrapers from stealing
#          your website's content. Feel free to copy and use whichever entries
#          you like, ignoring whichever entries you care to. The freedom to
#          block or share your own content is in your hands.
#
# Note: Nothing here actually prevents scrapers from stealing your content.
#       'robots.txt' is a gentleman's agreement between websites and crawlers.
#       There's nothing technical to force crawlers to respect this file.
